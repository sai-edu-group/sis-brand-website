  College Board's Advanced Placement Program is recognized by universities around the world as a standard of academic excellence. Since 1955, the AP Program has enabled millions of students to take U.S. university undergraduate-level courses and earn undergraduate degree credit, advanced placement, or both while still in high school/secondary school.
</p>

<p class="fade-in">
  Nearly all colleges and universities in the United States—as well as more than 500 universities in 75 countries such as the U.K., Canada, and Australia—consider AP participation favorably for admission and have policies around AP credit and placement.
</p>

<p class="fade-in"> 
  AP Exams are administered once every year during the first two-three weeks of May. Registration in the Fall prior to the testing year is strongly recommended to ensure students have time to prepare.
