    content: `<p class="fade-in"><strong>Cambridge English Language Assessment (CELA) </strong> is an annual program of SAI International School since the year 2009 in which the students get an opportunity to appear for a Cambridge University examination in English meant for speakers of other languages across the world. Every year hundreds of students register for these examinations, who are thoroughly trained through 20 preparatory classes.</p>
    <p>These tests assess all four language skills like listening, reading, writing and speaking which helps to provide a comprehensive picture of the learner’s overall level of English not only to secure a bright future but also meet the global standards. <strong>Students from Classes II to XII are eligible to take part in the assessment test </strong> and receive certificates from the University of Cambridge. The students appear for various levels like YLE (Starters, Movers and Flyers), Key for Schools (KET), Preliminary for Schools (PET), Business English Certificate (BEC) Preliminary and BEC Vantage. CELA offers students a structured way to improve their English language skills.</p>
