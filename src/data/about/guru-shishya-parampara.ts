      <p>SAI International has incorporated the timeless values of the Guru Shishya Parampara. Our deep-rooted belief is enshrined in the fact that a Guru is believed to be one who indoctrinates the Shishya to attain the ultimate truth or satya and mokshya – the salvation.</p>

      <p>A true Guru disseminates knowledge and initiates the first steps towards complete growth of body, mind and spirit within the framework of righteousness and true virtues. The virtuosity of a Guru lies in exposing the entire cosmos to the shishya, with its true bounties. He instils in the learner the permanence of evolving and mastering the skills yet inspires the art of discriminating the real from the virtual. The Guru’s skill elicits the true irradiance of the inherent gem like quality of each learner and enables the learner to nurture and retain the spirituality within, in the transient world.</p>

      <p>Indians have followed this tradition as the widest mode to impart education since the Vedic times and this ageless legacy has been bequeathed to us by our forefathers. It has endowed us to attain spirituality amidst success.</p>

      <p>SAI International has continued its odyssey from the transient to the permanent, with this Parampara. The Guru is the venerated enlightening source of knowledge, ready to adopt and adapt the contemporary ways of teaching and evolve towards the true essence of education and be a cocoon of love and empathy in the entire process of growth and development of the learner.</p>

      <p>Just as the sun illumines every object with its brilliance and warmth, the Guru imparts the depth of knowledge to the students which brightens up their horizons. It inspires them to undertake the challenges lying beyond and redefine the horizons of success in their lives.We believe that the intellect of the Guru promulgates wisdom in the lives of the students who accept spirituality as an extension of providence in their lives.</p>

      <p>The Guru is trained perfectly in imparting education and instils the wisdom underlying the facts so that inadvertently the wisdom and values slowly get adopted as a way of life in the young learner. We teach our youth to honour and respect the teacher as the source of inspiration to go beyond excellence….</p>


      <p>The principle of this relationship is that knowledge, especially subtle or advanced, is best conveyed through a strong human relationship based on ideals of the student’s respect, commitment, devotion and obedience, and on personal instruction by which the student eventually masters the knowledge that the guru embodies.</p>

      <p>We work towards promoting a strong learning towards our heritage, yet go more than just respecting it. We believe in adopting and evolving towards the modernity, with a strong accent on harmonious balance.</p>

      <p>In developing this concept, we transfer an inner virtue onto another person enabling and empowering an individual over us as a consequence of the projection, carrying the potential for greater insight and inspiration.</p>

      <p>“Gurur Brahma Gurur Vishnu Gurur Devo Maheswara, Gurur Saakshat Param Brahma Tasmai Shri Gurave Namaha”.</p>
