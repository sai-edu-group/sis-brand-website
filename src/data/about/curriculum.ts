      <p>Horse riding is recognized as having excellent therapeutic qualities. The psychological benefits can be of equal importance to riders as the physical benefits. Simply being outdoors and enjoying the ride on an open field boosts the general well-being and acts as a great stress buster. There is a real sense of excitement and freedom when one rides, a feeling that is second to none. Furthermore, developing a relationship and sense of trust between the students and another living being is highly rewarding. We believe that when students learn to control and care for an animal much larger than themselves, it can have a profound effect on their confidence. The horses under the expert training of our trainers can be seen in the campus and are a much cherished part of the SAI family.</p>`,

The learning activities of STEAM education also help students develop the essential qualities associated with an entrepreneurial spirit. Turning ideas into tangible/perceivable form is not merely about production and fabrication, but also involves self-learning, problem-solving, exploration, experimentation and critical thinking. It is also associated with taking calculated risks, and sometimes failing and again coming back with resilience to solve the problems. School facilitates hands on practice where the students are exposed to digital tools to create, make, design and implement the ideas. Through the hands-on activities, workshops, inspiring talks, inspiring works from other makers, they learn immensely.</p>
      <p><strong>Experiential Learning –</strong> Students are exposed to mega events like UNWIND and SAITED which are for the students and by the students. They handle the event through and through, right from the finances to planning marketing, digital designing, sales, liasoning and collaborating to make the event a mega success. In this process they learn the skills through experience and a collaborative approach.</p>`,
