<p><strong>Learning Beyond Classrooms</strong></p>
<p>At SAI International School, effective teaching and meaningful learning thrive at the intersection of theory and practice. Classroom instruction is seamlessly complemented by hands-on laboratory experiences, enabling students to explore concepts deeply, ask questions freely, and gain clarity through experimentation. This integrated approach ensures that learning is not merely memorised, but understood, experienced, and retained for life.</p>

<p>Our laboratories are thoughtfully designed to nurture curiosity, encourage inquiry, and strengthen conceptual understanding. Through experiential learning, students develop critical thinking, creativity, collaboration, and problem-solving abilities, skills essential for success in a rapidly evolving global landscape.</p>

<p>The primary objective of our laboratories is to cultivate <strong>SAI Learning Skills </strong> and <strong>SAI Social Skills</strong>, empowering students to rise above the ordinary and emerge as confident global thinkers and leaders.</p>

<p><strong>Benefits of Laboratory Learning</strong></p>

<p>Laboratory teaching transforms abstract ideas into tangible experiences. Experiments and practical activities help students satisfy their natural curiosity, deepen their understanding of subjects, and retain knowledge long after the lesson is complete. By engaging both mind and hand, laboratories foster independent thinking, scientific temperament, teamwork, and innovation.</p>

<p>Experiential learning lies at the heart of our philosophy, and to support this vision, SAI International School offers multiple <strong>state-of-the-art laboratories</strong> across disciplines.</p>

      content: `<p>In affirmation with our adopted theory of Multiple Intelligence by Dr. Howard Gardener, we work on the 360 degree development of the students. Music and Dance or the SAI Nritya and Sangeet Kala are important components of school education, the benefits of which have been largely documented. We have eight music labs and a dance lab in the School, catering to the likes and interests of our students.</p>
      <p><strong>Purpose – </strong> The purpose of having music and dance labs is to provide the students an understanding of the fundamentals of these forms of expression at the same time strengthening their bond with one of the finest forms of art. Exploring the various dimensions of music, whether performing a vocal solo, rehearsing to tune the strings or creating compositions, the main aim of the music labs of the school is to nurture creativity.</p>
      <p>At the dance lab children learning the classical as well as modern form of dance</p>
      <p><strong>Faculty –</strong> The trained music faculty is committed to give the students the tools they need to study and perform, as well as the confidence and inspiration to pursue the music they find inspiring, ultimately making them calm, composed and in sync with their spiritual self.</p>
      <p>SAI International School has dedicated music and dance teachers with music and dance labs such as Piano and Keyboard Lab, Guitar Lab, Flute Lab, Sitar Lab, Tabla, Drums Percussion, Violin and Vocal labs.</p>`,

      content: `<p>STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics) means teaching and learning different subjects using more than one manner. Documenting & observing the environment or phenomena; Applying science for practical purposes; Designing, building, using engines, machines, and structures; Expressing or applying human creative skill and imagination; Studying numbers, quantities, shapes and the relations between them helps children to find a co-relation between subjects and make them comprehend the projects and learning better.</p>
      <p><strong>Inter disciplinary learning –</strong> At SAI International School, special emphasis is laid on experience based learning and an inter disciplinary approach to learning where rigorous academic concepts and topics are merged and aligned with real world lessons. To compete with the new economy and newer technology, the students are encouraged to apply Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics to make connections between school, community, work, and the globe. In today’s economy it is essential to develop the core STEAM skills (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics) and encourage the children to be successful globally.</p>
      <p><strong>Benefit – </strong>To enable the students, we stimulate their brains by giving them inter-disciplinary projects for the subjects like Mathematics, Science, English, Social Studies, Computer Science and Hindi. Children are brainstormed on the topics given and are left to innovate and exhibit their learning in a unique manner.</p>
      <p><strong>Our Objectives – </strong>We strive to further develop, among students, a strong knowledge base aligned with the latest changes in these disciplines, and strengthen their ability to integrate and apply knowledge and skills, to nurture their creativity and innovation, collaboration and problem solving skills, which are essential skills and competencies required in the 21st century. The learning activities of STEAM education also help students develop the essential qualities associated with an entrepreneurial spirit. Turning ideas into tangible/perceivable form is not merely about production and fabrication, but also involves self-learning, problem-solving, exploration, experimentation and critical thinking. It is also associated with taking calculated risks, and sometimes failing and again coming back with resilience to solve the problems. School facilitates hands on practice where the students are exposed to digital tools to create, make, design and implement the ideas. Through the hands-on activities, workshops, inspiring talks, inspiring works from other makers, they learn immensely.</p>
      <p><strong>Experiential Learning –</strong> Students are exposed to mega events like UNWIND and SAITED which are for the students and by the students. They handle the event through and through, right from the finances to planning marketing, digital designing, sales, liasoning and collaborating to make the event a mega success. In this process they learn the skills through experience and a collaborative approach.</p>`,
