      content: `<p>SAI International School is now affiliated to the Cambridge Assessment International Education, International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE), UK to offer its world-leading Cambridge programme, in addition to the existing CBSE affiliation.SAI has received affiliation for the early years,the IGCSE and the AS& Alevels. The primary segment is a completely IGCSE school now and for the rest of the classes from IV onwards, both IGCSE and CBSE curriculum will be followed simultaneously.</p>
      <p>The Cambridge program starts with the Early Years which is for ages 3 to 5 plus,(Nursery-KG II) followed by the levels for 6 to 10 year olds which means Classes I to V.These formative years help students develop their cognitive skills to the fullest, giving ample scope for the basic skills development.</p>
      <p>The Cambridge programme for students aged 11 to 19 is made up of three stages – Cambridge Lower Secondary, Cambridge Upper Secondary and Cambridge Advanced – giving students a clear path for educational success. Each stage combines a world-class curriculum, high-quality support for teachers and integrated assessment.A team of well qualified and Cambridge trained teachers will teach the IGCSE segment.</p>
      <p>Cambridge Upper Secondary leads to Cambridge IGCSE, the world’s most popular international qualification for 14 to 16 year olds. Cambridge Advanced prepares students for university and higher education, and leads to Cambridge International AS & A Level qualifications.</p>
      <p>IGCSE is one of the most recognised international qualifications in the world. Though in the SAI International School we have developed and encouraged vital educational skills, including oral skills, investigative skills, problem solving, teamwork and initiative through our global processes, the Cambridge collaboration will further add the international dimension to our teaching learning process. As we prepare our children to be tomorrow’s citizens in the rapidly changing globalised world, the new programme will be infused with international understanding and intercultural behaviour.</p>
      <p>The well balanced IGCSE program with worldwide status and credibility is completely in sync with the NEP 2020 as well as our own mode of experiential learning and lends an international perspective to studies.</p>
      <p>Since the course holds international recognition, it is apt for students who want to pursue higher education abroad as most of the universities of Australia and UK accept IGCSE students even without IELTS and TOEFL and it is equally well recognised by top universities and colleges in India.</p>
